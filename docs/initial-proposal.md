# Initial Proposal
CSSE1001 Assignment 3

The proposed project is the creation of Python software tools to use the sensors
from a Kinect via the Kinect for Windows SDK. In particular, the range finding
sensor is to be used to create a depth map of the Kinect's surroundings.
Positioning will also be added, allowing for a hands-off approach to mapping the
environment.

A visualisation tool will also be created, using either OpenGL or PyQt (or a
similar windowing system) as appropriate. This will allow viewing of the
collected data on other systems based on the collected data at a later date. A
semi-live preview may also be created to view the data as it is collected,
depending on whether it is viable to do so.
